# GyulHap game

This is an Android game based off the game played in the show, *The Genuis*. The rule is that given 2 minutes, you need to find as many triple sets of squares that comply with the rules - select three squares that follow the rules. 
Rules are: 
* the background colour of the squares which the shape is contained in must either be all the same colour **or** all different colours.
* the background colour of the shapes (square, circle, triangle) must also be either all the same colour **or** all different colours.
* the shapes must all be the same shapes **or** all different shapes.
